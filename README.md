Careen is my boilerplate and notes for spinning up a new project quickly.

## Tools
 
 - React
  - React Router & HashRouter for gh-pages hosted SPAs
    - React Router Bootstrap for the LinkContainer component
  - React Burger Menu
  - A-Frame for 3D stuff
 - gh-pages for hosting
 - Firebase Functions
 - Firebase Datastore
 - Firebase Hosting if appropriate
 - Auto 0 for authentication
 - D3 for visualizations
 - Snap for really interesting visualizations
 - Google Domains & a CNAME file

### Setup

 - Run ```create-react-app```
 - Install ```gh-pages```
 - modify the package.json to include the homepage and deployment steps
outlined [here](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md#github-pages)
 - alias ```npm run build``` and ```npm run deploy``` to *build* and *deploy*
 - go ahead and run build and deploy to make sure everythingis working
